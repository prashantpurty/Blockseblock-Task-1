# Blockseblock Task 1

A JavaScript-based simulation of fundamental blockchain concepts, including block creation, consensus mechanisms, and mining processes.

## Overview

This project demonstrates key blockchain principles through simple JavaScript simulations. It includes:

* **Blockchain Simulation**: Basic implementation of a blockchain with block creation and linking.
* **Consensus Demo**: Illustrates how consensus algorithms work to maintain agreement across distributed nodes.
* **Mining Simulation**: Simulates the mining process, showcasing proof-of-work and block validation.

## File Descriptions

* `Blockchain_simulation.js`: Simulates the creation and linking of blocks in a blockchain.
* `consensus_demo.js`: Demonstrates a consensus algorithm to achieve agreement among nodes.
* `mining_simulation.js`: Simulates the mining process, including proof-of-work and block validation.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/prashantpurty/Blockseblock-Task--1.git
   cd Blockseblock-Task--1
   ```



2. **Run the Simulations**:
   Ensure you have Node.js installed. Execute each script using Node.js:

   ```bash
   node Blochain_simulation.js
   node consensus_demo.js
   node mining_simulation.js
   ```

Task - 2 Added to Repository 

## Requirements

* Node.js (v14 or higher recommended)
